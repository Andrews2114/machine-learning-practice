# machine-learning-practice
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of an artificially generated dataset of asthma patients using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. The project is designed to explore various aspects of machine learning, from data preprocessing to advanced modeling and evaluation. The analysis is documented in a Jupyter Notebook, and the results are summarized in a PDF report.

# Project Highlights
## Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values (NA's) and ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Correlation heatmap to visualize relationships between variables.

Histograms for numerical variables to understand their distributions.

Bar plots for categorical variables to analyze their frequency distributions.

Identification of data imbalance between diagnosed and non-diagnosed patients, recommended stratification for training.

## Supervised Learning
Model Training and Evaluation:

Test-train split for training and evaluating models.

Application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

Confusion matrices to evaluate model performance.

Histogram comparison of predicted vs. actual diagnoses.

Cross-validation to ensure model robustness.

## Unsupervised Learning
Clustering:

Application of K-means and K-prototypes clustering algorithms.

Use of Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), Silhouette Score, and Elbow Method to determine optimal cluster numbers.

Dimensionality Reduction:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to clustering for better visualization and interpretation.

# Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate the application of various machine learning techniques in a real-world scenario. The analysis covers a wide range of tools and methods, from basic statistical analysis to advanced machine learning algorithms. This project highlights the importance of understanding and applying these tools effectively to derive meaningful insights from data.

# Acknowledgments
The dataset used in this project is artificially generated for educational purposes.

Special thanks to the open-source community for providing the tools and libraries that made this analysis possible.
